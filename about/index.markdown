## Who I am

I am primarily a  .NET developer. I however keep exploring , I have tried my  hands on Ruby , Java , Angular Js and anything new I can get a hand on.
I also love to root my Android phone and hack it.


## What I do

I have worked as Senior Developer ,  Business Analyst & Husband amongst other things.
I love everything Agile. The correct incremental one . Not the cyclic one!
